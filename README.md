# S2.1: Modern JavaScript Fundamentals
This repository contains the solved exercises for Sprint 2.1, focused on practicing and understanding the fundamentals of modern JavaScript (ES6+).

## Sprint Objectives

This module was designed to cover the following key areas of the language:

Arrow Functions: Understanding and practicing their usage, including the handling of this.

Ternary Operator: Application in various decision-making contexts.

Callbacks: Usage with both synchronous and asynchronous functions.

Rest & Spread Operators: Efficient use for arrays and objects.

Array Transformations: Mastering map, filter, find, and reduce.

Array and Object Loops: Practice with forEach, for-of, for-in, some, and every.

Promises & Async/Await: Handling asynchronicity and error control.
